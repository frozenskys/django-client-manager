#Simple Client Manager#

* Provides a simple way to store data about clients (Notes, Access, Contacts, etc)
* This does not store information securly such as client passwords.  I only intend to run this application locally.
* The purpose of this project is really to gain a deeper understanding of the options available via the Djano admin.
